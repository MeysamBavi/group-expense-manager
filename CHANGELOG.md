- More layouts for time: You can enter the time in more formats like `15:4 2006/1/2`, `2006/1/2` and `2006-1-2` or completely **omit** it.
- Improved the error logs: Logs now report the location of the error in the input file (sheet and cell).
- Improved the documentation: [README](https://github.com/MeysamBavi/group-expense-manager/blob/main/README.md) and command descriptions are now more clear and detailed.
